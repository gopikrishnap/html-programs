                   <p>Telugu cinema, also known by its sobriquet Tollywood, is the segment of Indian cinema dedicated to the production of motion pictures in the Telugu language, based in Film Nagar, a neighborhood of Hyderabad.[4] Since 1909, film maker Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was involved in producing short films and travelling to different regions in Asia to promote film work. In 1921, he produced the first Telugu silent film, Bhishma Pratigna. He is cited as the father of Telugu cinema.[5][6] 
                    In 1933, East India Film Company has produced its first Indian film, Savitri in Telugu. The film was based on a popular stage play by Mylavaram Bala Bharathi Samajam, directed by father of the "Telugu theatre Movement" Chittajallu Pullaiah and cast stage actors Vemuri Gaggaiah and Dasari Ramathilakam as "Yama" and "Savithri" respectively</p>.<p>[8] The film was shot with a budget of estimated ₹1 million (US$15,000) in Calcutta.[9] The blockbuster film has received an honorary diploma at the 2nd Venice International Film Festival.[10]
                    
                    The first film studio in South India, Durga Cinetone, was built in 1936 by Nidamarthi Surayya in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh.[11] The 1951 film Patala Bhairavi was the only South Indian film screened at the first India International Film Festival,[12][13] held in Mumbai on 24 January 1952.[14][15][16] CNN-IBN listed Patala Bhairavi (1951), Malliswari (1951), Devadasu (1953), Mayabazar (1957), Nartanasala (1963), Maro Charithra (1978), Maa Bhoomi (1979), Sankarabharanam (1979), Sagara Sangamam (1983), and Siva (1989), among The 100 Greatest India
                     Films of All Time.[17] In the years 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2014 the industry has produced the largest number of films in India, exceeding the number of films produced in Bollywood.[18][19]
                    
                    The industry holds the Guinness World Record for the largest film production facility in the world, Ramoji Film City.[20] The Prasads IMAX located in Hyderabad is one of the largest 3D IMAX screens, and the most attended cinema screen in the world.[21][22][23] As per the CBFC report of 2014, the industry is placed first in India, in terms of films produced yearly.[24] The industry holds a memorandum of understanding with the Motion Picture Association of America to combat video piracy.[25][26][27] The Baahubali (franchise) produced by Tollywood studio Arka Media Works is the highest grossing Indian multilingual film of all time globally with a cumulative box office earnings of approximately ₹2,000 crore (US$310 million).</p>
